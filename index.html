            <p>In 2022, I will fulfill my missions one by one. I have been thinking since 2020 that I will learn
                something
                relatted to programming. In 2022, I started a webdevelopment course. I wish I could do something better
                by
                practice a lot. Because nothing can be done in life without practicing. If i fail i will start again but
                i
                have
                to be able to have this mindset. Lost to try. Time will tell. I have to accept these things.</p>
